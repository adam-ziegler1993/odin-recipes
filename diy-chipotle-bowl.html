        <h2>Here's what you'll need to make 4 bowls:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1lb Grass-fed, Grass-finished beef</li>
            <li>2 cups of dry rice</li>
            <li>6 normal tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>2 avocados</li>
            <li>1lb frozen corn</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded cheese</li>
            <li>1 bag of spinach</li>
            <li>1 tub of sour cream</li>
            <li>2 bags of chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Let's put it together:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>At the same time, add the 1lb ground beef to a pan set on high and 2 cups of rice to a pot of water. Bring the rice pot to a boil and let it sit, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>While the beef and rice are cooking, chop the tomatoes and onions up and place into a bowl.</li>
            <li>Cut the avocado in half, take out the seed, and slice the avocado into cubes... Be sure to keep the peel on so you can set it on the counter</li>
            <li>Grab a handful of spinach and place in each bowl. Do 1 cut vertically and 1 cut horizontally through the spinach leaves.</li>
            <li>By now, the beef should be done. Set the beef in a separate container.</li>
            <li>We want to use the fat from the ground beef to cook the corn. So place the frozen corn in the beef pan and place on high until thawed.</li>
            <li>Starting to prepar the bowls, you'll start by putting a 1/2 cup of rice on top of the spinach</li>
            <li>Then, the ground beef. However much is left after cooking, split into 4 equal amounts and place on top of the rice.</li>
            <li>The tomatoes and onions go on top next.</li>
            <li>Cut the cubes of avocado out of the shell and place on the bowls.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle some cheese on top, with a dollop of sour cream.</li>
        </ol>
